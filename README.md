# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signals. It utilizes **Logistic Regression** for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is `SONAR.csv`. The target labels are:
- **R**: Rock
- **M**: Mine

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Training & Test Data Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy metrics.
5. **Making Predictions**: Test the model with sample inputs.
